# PhotonBullShitHash v0.2

INCLUDES==

A non-cryptographic hash function I made for fun. It's horrible.
It's slow as hell. It has a 128 bit hash length.
The program can hash a string or a file and print it to standard output.

A pseudo-random-number-generator which outputs 128-bit random numbers.
The program can print a user-determined quantity to standard output.
The seed is based off of the current system time.

Enjoy the bullshit!
